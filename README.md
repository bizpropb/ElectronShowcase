# Electron Feature Explorer

This project was an attempt to build a comprehensive Electron application showcasing native desktop capabilities. The application is functional but the project has been discontinued due to fundamental architectural issues.

## What This Was

A desktop application demonstrating Electron's capabilities:
- Window management and system tray integration
- Desktop notifications with actions
- File system operations and dialogs
- Clipboard integration and history
- Global keyboard shortcuts
- System information dashboard
- Shell integration and protocol handlers
- Persistent storage with encryption
- Multi-window management

Built with Electron, electron-store, pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

Here’s a concise “Getting Started” you can paste straight into your README.  
It assumes the code is already in the repo and the only thing missing are the exact steps to run it.

## Getting It Running
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

## Status: Abandoned

See **aFatalMistake.md** for the reasons why.
